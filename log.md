# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday March 6 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** Really interesting! Slightly overwhelming trying to track what each attribute does, but overall I think I am getting the hang of things slightly. A lot of moments where I thought "oh! so that's how that actually works".

### Day 2: Sunday March 7 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 70% of the Basic CSS course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts**: Still interesting! I remember some of the terminology "margins, borders, padding" from the Wordpress website editors I've used so its cool to see the background code behind all of this. I feel like I am slowly memorising some of the basic foundations (e.g what brackets to use) after doing some of the tutorials which didn't have as much guidance. Looking forward to learning more.

### Day 3: Monday March 8 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic CSS course and around half of the Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** Getting harder. Had to use a couple of hints and also do some googling to understand some concepts. Still wrapping my head around element positioning especially. But, I now know how hex codes work! At this stage, it's hard to see how people got from this to the beautiful websites we have today.

### Day 4: Tuesday March 9 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** Getting complex. Have the hang of some concepts e.g style, ID, but other concepts I am struggling to grasp e.g Bezier Curves. I wonder how this all fits together in the end. Following the tutorials is fine but I feel like I would have no idea if left to my own devices.

### Day 5: Wednesday March 10 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Accessibility course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** This was interesting! It's really heartening to see the work being done to make the internet a more accessible place. It also made me think about all the websites I have amateurly made in the past which didn't keep to these accessibility rules. Also, the amount of elements and attributes for me to know are just heaps! I wonder how developers remember what to use?

### Day 6: Thursday March 11 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Responsive Web Design Principles and CSS Flexbox courses on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** Responsive web design course was short and I am still grappling with its ideas (as I am with all of this). The CSS Flexbox course was more straightforward, though I am interested to see how it works in practice. I'm excited to reach the end and start on my project!

### Day 7: Saturday March 13 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Grid course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** Skipped a day due to social commitments lol. This course was short and sweet, and I feel like I have a good grasp on the concepts. My next task is my first project! Nervously excited to finally be able to create something - I predict it will be difficult but hopefully worth it.

### Day 8: Sunday March 14 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the basic skeleton of my tribute page for freeCodeCamp's project

**Thoughts** Wow! Starting a project without the hand-holding of freeCodeCamp's exercises is tough! A lot of time spent lost/overwhelmed, trying to create the basic foundations my tribute page (it is on Jurgen Klopp). Have managed to build a bassic skeleton though and will need to iron out a heap of kinks before it resembles anything readable. All part of the learning process I guess!

### Day 9: Monday March 15 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to tweak my tribute page for freeCodeCamp's project

**Thoughts** My Jurgen Klopp themed tribute page is slow progress. A lot of things I took for granted on Wordpress editors now need careful html coding, and I have been going back through tutorials and googling to figure out what I need to do. For example, spent a while trying to align the bullet points of an unordered list with the list content. Excited to learn more and get closer to completing my page though!

### Day 10: Tuesday March 16 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to tweak my tribute page for freeCodeCamp's project

**Thoughts** Pleased that I made some progress, specifically fixing the alignment of the text, cleaning up some messy CSS and remembering how to make the image responsive. I'm maybe halfway there on this? Best thing today was finding out the editor layout in Codepen where the code is on the side, not on top - a real lifesaver!

### Day 11: Wednesday March 17 2021

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my tribute page for freeCodeCamp's project

**Thoughts** I have passed the tests! Can't take complete credit as some parts of my website were copied off the freeCodeCamp example but the page is fully functional now. Next step, the "fun" part of researching and writing the content for it. Will try not get distracted by other stuff as I do some research about Jurgen Klopp!
