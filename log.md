# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, Saturday, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** Really interesting! Slightly overwhelming trying to track what each attribute does, but overall I think I am getting the hang of things slightly. A lot of moments where I thought "oh! so that's how that actually works".

### Day 2: March 7, Sunday, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 70% of the Basic CSS course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts**: Still interesting! I remember some of the terminology "margins, borders, padding" from the Wordpress website editors I've used so its cool to see the background code behind all of this. I feel like I am slowly memorising some of the basic foundations (e.g what brackets to use) after doing some of the tutorials which didn't have as much guidance. Looking forward to learning more.

### Day 3: March 8, Monday, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic CSS course and around half of the Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** Getting harder. Had to use a couple of hints and also do some googling to understand some concepts. Still wrapping my head around element positioning especially. But, I now know how hex codes work! At this stage, it's hard to see how people got from this to the beautiful websites we have today.

### Day 4: March 9, Tuesday, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts** Getting complex. Have the hang of some concepts e.g style, ID, but other concepts I am struggling to grasp e.g Bezier Curves. I wonder how this all fits together in the end. Following the tutorials is fine but I feel like I would have no idea if left to my own devices.
