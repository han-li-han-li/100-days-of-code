# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2011 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** Really interesting! Slightly overwhelming trying to track what each attribute does, but overall I think I am getting the hang of things slightly. A lot of moments where I thought "oh! so that's how that actually works".

### Day 2: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 70% of the Basic CSS course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts**: Still interesting! I remember some of the terminology "margins, borders, padding" from the Wordpress website editors I've used so its cool to see the background code behind all of this. I feel like I am slowly memorising some of the basic foundations (e.g what brackets to use) after doing some of the tutorials which didn't have as much guidance. Looking forward to learning more.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
