# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2011 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** Really interesting! Slightly overwhelming trying to track what each attribute does, but overall I think I am getting the hang of things slightly. A lot of moments where I thought "oh! so that's how that actually works".

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
